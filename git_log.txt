ab87dda Improve alpha handling in multi-slice processing by introducing thresholds for low-alpha samples, ensuring accurate color retrieval from neighboring pixels. Update logic to prevent color bleeding by treating low-alpha samples as "unknown color" and adjusting color accumulation accordingly. Enhance comments for clarity on the new approach.
041a2df Enhance multi-slice processing by introducing functions for shifted source coordinate calculations and straight color estimation from neighboring pixels. Update color accumulation logic to utilize straight color values for improved blending accuracy, preventing color bleeding from transparent samples. Refactor existing functions for clarity and maintainability.
318803f Refactor multi-slice color accumulation to utilize premultiplied channels, enhancing blending accuracy and preventing color bleeding from low-alpha samples. Update comments for clarity on the new accumulation strategy.
